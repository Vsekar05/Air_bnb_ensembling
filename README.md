I have created a app in which I have used Ensemble learning on the Air bnb dataset this app can show the scores for the following Classifiers
AdaBoost Classifier
Bagging Classifer
Gradient Boosting
Voting Classifier

I have used the many machine learning algorithms like
Decision Tre Classifier
Support Vector Machine
